unitize
=======

The Sass functions in [_unitize.scss](https://github.com/justinskolnick/unitize/blob/master/_unitize.scss) provide all the benefits of relative units like `em` and `rem` without the hassle of having to run calculations. Whole numbers are nice.

`Unitize` processes numerical values as well as those declarations that Sass identifies as [lists](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#lists). Lists include shorthand CSS declarations like `2px 4px 5px 3px` and `inset 2px 2px 4px black`. Strings, colors, and values already assigned a unit (e.g., `inset`, `#000`, `20%`) pass undisturbed through the function.

## Usage

For examples and recommended uses, see [test.scss](https://github.com/justinskolnick/unitize/blob/master/test.scss), along with the compiled CSS in [test.css](https://github.com/justinskolnick/unitize/blob/master/test.css).

`font-size: em(7, 27);` yields `font-size: 0.25925925925926em;`
