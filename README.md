unitize
=======

The Sass functions in [_unitize.scss](https://github.com/justinskolnick/unitize/blob/master/_unitize.scss) provide all the benefits of relative units like `em` and `rem` without the hassle of having to run calculations. Whole numbers are nice.

`Unitize` processes numerical values as well as those declarations that Sass identifies as [lists](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#lists). Lists include shorthand CSS declarations like `2px 4px 5px 3px` and `inset 2px 2px 4px black`. Strings, colors, and values already assigned a unit (e.g., `inset`, `#000`, `20%`) pass undisturbed through the function.

## How it works

### Configuration

First, install _unitize.scss and `@import 'unitize'`. In a separate config file or at the top of your SCSS, declare a root font size (in pixels, without the unit). The default is `12`.

```SCSS
$root-font-size: 10;
```

If using rems in your CSS, set the document's root font size on the HTML element as pixels or a percentage. Given a `$root-font-size` of `10`, the rulesets below yield `12px` and `62.5%`, respectively.

```SCSS
html {
//  font-size: $root-font-size + px;
  font-size: percentage($root-font-size/16);
}
```

### Usage

Send values through one of `em()`, `rem()`, or `unitize()`. The following examples assume the default `$root-font-size` of 12.

`unitize()` returns `px` values:

```SCSS
// $root-font-size: 12;

margin: unitize(4 6% 2 9px);
// => margin: 4px 6% 2px 9px;

box-shadow: unitize(inset 5 2 #cfc);
// => box-shadow: inset 5px 2px #ccffcc;
```

`rem()` returns values in rems, relative to the `$root-font-size`:

```SCSS
// $root-font-size: 12;

padding: rem(4 6 2 9);
// => padding: 0.33333rem 0.5rem 0.16667rem 0.75rem;

text-shadow: rem(3 3 6 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5));
// => text-shadow: 0.25rem 0.25rem 0.5rem rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
```

`em()` yields values relative to the `$root-font-size` or an optional second argument.

```SCSS
// $root-font-size: 12;

font-size: em(12);
// => font-size: 1em;

line-height: em(18, 12);
// => line-height: 1.5em;
```
